# Principles of Information Systems — Demo Site

This is a very small static demo site created as an example.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — simple stylesheet
- `script.js` — small JS for mobile nav and form behavior

How to view:
- Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or run a simple local server.

Quick local server (PowerShell):

```powershell
# Python 3 built-in server
python -m http.server 8000; Start-Process "http://localhost:8000"

# Or using Node (if installed)
# npx http-server -c-1 . -p 8000
```
